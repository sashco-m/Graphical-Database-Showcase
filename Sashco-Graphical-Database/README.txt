This database software enables a company to manage its clients
in an easy, intuitive, and user friendly way. TACAD offers
functuality for viewing an entire database of up to 1000 clients,
as well as sorting them by various attributes, adding new clients,
deleting former clients, and searching individual clients. TACAD
uses the Java programming language, making heavy use of the
Swing toolkit for the high-tech user interface system.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:

each client. Every customer should have their own line within the
file, and their information should be formatted as in the following
examples, using slashes:

Forename/Surname/Address/Phone Number/Age/Salary

John/Doe/123 Street Rd./416-555-6789/20/50000

Name the file "accounts.txt" and store it in the TACAD folder.
